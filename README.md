# A_star_ROS_Gazebo
Implementation of A* , FDA* and a Visibility Graph Approach Using ROS and Gazebo

Implemented and evaluated A*, FDA* and a visibility graph approach using 8-neighbors grids. For the experiments and the comparisons, the project used 5 polygonal environments and defined 10 different start and goal locations per environment, for a total of 50 different benchmarks. Finally, implemented the A* search over the reduced visibility graph in an implicit manner.
